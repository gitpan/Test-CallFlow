=head1 SYNOPSIS

Mock packages for planning expected interactions in tests:

    use Test::CallFlow qw(:all);

    my $mocked = mock_object( 'My::Mocked::Package::Name' );
    $mocked->my_method( arg_any(0,9) )->result( 'return value' );

    mock_run();

    die "test did not return right value"
      if $mocked->my_method( 'any', 'arguments' ) ne 'return value';

    mock_end();
    
=head1 USAGE

    use Test::More plan_tests => 1;
    use Test::CallFlow qw(:all);

    # just mock a package
    mock_package( 'Just::Mocked' );

    # mock a package and make an object of it
    my $mocked = mock_object(
        'My::Mocked::Package::Name',          # must specify package name
        { 'optional' => 'content' } );        # may specify what to bless

    Foo::Bar->new()                           # no arguments
              ->result( $mocked );            # return the mock object

    my $get_call =                            # refer to this Test::CallFlow::Call object
        $mocked->get( "FieldX" )              # one equal string argument
             ->result( 1, 2, 3 )              # return array ( 1, 2, 3 ) on first call
             ->result( 4, 5, 6 )              # return array ( 4, 5, 6 ) on second call
             ->result( 7, 8, 9 )              # return array ( 7, 8, 9 ) on any subsequent calls
             ->min(0)                         # this call is optional
             ->max(9)                         # this call can be made at most 9 times
             ->anytime;                       # may be called at this step or any time later

    $mocked->set( arg_check( qr/^Field/ ),    # first argument matching regular expression
                  arg_any( 1, 99 ) );         # 1-99 arguments with any values
                                              # return nothing (undef or empty array)

    $mocked->save( arg_check( \&ok_file ) )   # use own code to check argument
             ->end( $get_call );              # end scope: $get_call can be made no more

    # if you wish to use parts of the real package unmocked as is,
    # load it after planning but before running:
    use My::Mocked::Package::Name;
    
    # remember that nothing keeps you from still just adding your own:
    
    package My::Mocked::Package::Name;
    
    sub really_customized {} # skipping mock system

    package main; # remember to end your own package definition

    mock_run();  # flow of calls from test planned, now prepare to run the test(s)

    eval {

      # package was already declared as loaded at mock_run()
      # so code under test may freely try to 'use' it
      use My::Mocked::Package::Name;

      code_under_test();  # dies on any unplanned call to a mocked package or sub

      mock_end(); # dies if any expected calls were not made and reports them
    };

    is( $@, '', "code_under_test() executed according to prepared plan" );
    
    mock_clear(); # flush state, plan and mocks so you may plan another test call flow

=head2 RECORDING

To make it easier to start refactoring existing complicated legacy code,
C<Test::CallFlow> also provides preliminary sub call recording functionality:

    # load the packages used by code under test first
    use My::Mocked::Package::Name;
    use Other::Mocked::Package;

    # then declare them for mocking; this saves the original subs aside
    mock_package( 'My::Mocked::Package::Name', 'Other::Mocked::Package' );

    # start recording
    record_calls_from( 'Package::Under::Test' );
    
    # now calls to mocked packages will be made and recorded with their args and results
    use Package::Under::Test;
    Package::Under::Test->code_under_test();
    
    # generate code to serve as basis for your test run
    print join ";\n", map { $_->name() } mock_plan()->list_calls();

C<Test::CallFlow> is actually object-oriented; default instance creation is hidden.
Usability of multiple simultaneous mock objects is hindered by Perl global package namespace.
Only one object may be used for recording, planning or running at a time.
A separate object can be used for each of those tasks simultaneously as long as they don't mock same packages.
Just do one thing at a time and C<mock_clear()> straight after to steer clear of any problems.

=head1 PROPERTIES

Default properties are defined in C<Test::CallFlow::prototype>.
They may be specified as parameters for C<new>
or environment variables with prefix 'mock_', such as 'mock_ISA'.

Template texts below may contain C<#{variablename}> placeholders that will be
replaced by context-specific or C<Test::CallFlow> object property values.

=head2 TEMPLATE PROPERTIES

These may be useful for heavier customizations, although it'll probably be easier to just
define more hairy mock package parts straight in the test script.

=over 4

=item package_template

Template text for mock package definitions. See code for contents.

=over 8

=item C<#{packagename}> placeholders will be replaced by name of package to mock.

=item C<#{subs}> placeholders will be replaced by sub definitions.

=back

=item sub_template

Template for code to put into mocked subs.

=over 8

=item C<#{packagename}> placeholders will be replaced by name of package to mock.

=item C<#{subname}> placeholders will be replaced by name of sub to mock.

=back

=item autoload_template

Template for code to put into mocked AUTOLOAD subs.

=item package_definition_template

Template for package definition at C<mock_run>.

Default value contains redefinition warning suppression
and expects C<#{packagebody}> variable to contain actual mock package definition.

=back

=head2 INTERNAL PROPERTIES

These are set and used at planning and runtime.

=over 4

=item state

One of C<%Test::CallFlow::state> keys: C<unknown>, C<plan>, C<execute>, C<failed> or C<succeeded>.

Default is C<plan>.
C<mock_run()> sets state to C<execute>.
C<mock_end> sets it to C<succeeded> - or C<failed> if more calls were expected.
Failure in a mock call sets it to C<failed>.
C<mock_clear> and C<mock_reset> unconditionally set it back to C<plan>.

=item id

Index of this object in C<@Test::CallFlow::instances>.

=item packages

Contains data about packages and subs to mock gathered from calls in planning mode.

=item plan

Call execution plan as a C<Test::CallFlow::Plan> object containing C<Test::CallFlow::Call> objects.

=item record_calls_from

Hash of package names created by C<record_calls_from()> for checking which calls to record during recording.

=back

=head2 DEBUGGING PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item debug

Controls debug information printing.
Class names in this string cause debugging info to be printed from them.
Options are: C<Mock>, C<Plan>, C<Call>, C<ArgCheck>. Derived from C<$ENV{DEBUG}>.

=item debug_mock

Controls whether to print debug info in this class.

=back

=head2 PACKAGE SAVING PROPERTIES

Sometimes it might be nice to put the files into a temporary directory included in @INC,
or to keep them around for debugging or faster loading later.

=over 4

=item save

Whether to save package definitions into files. Default is not to save.

If set at construction, the temporary directory will be prepended to @INC so that
the mocks will load with C<use> hiding any real implementations.

=item basedir

Base directory for saving packages. Default is system temporary directory.

=item savedir

Template for name of subdirectory inside basedir to contain saved package file hierarchy.
Default is 'perl-mock-<process-id>-<mock-instance-number>'.

During plan buildup, adds calls to mock call plan list.

During test execution, tries to find a planned mock call matching given call.
Returns planned value. Dies on mismatch.

During recording calls the original method. If caller is a record candidate, records the call and result.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item * MockCommand 

Integration to cover external command calls.

=item * Tied Variables

Provide easy methods for recording, restricting and testing data access.

=item * Test::CallFlow::Package

Would allow for neat stuff like

  mock_package( 'Bar' )->vars( ISA => [ 'Foo' ], VERSION => 0.01 );

=item * ArgCheck::Hash

ArgChecker for deep structure comparison. Add also C<arg_deep>.

=item * ArgCheck::Array

ArgChecker for a match in a list; used as C<arg_check( \@in )>.

=item * Ref Checking

Document the fact that Regexp /^Type::Name=/ may be used for reference type checks.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 ALTERNATIVES

Test::CallFlow provides a very simple way to plan mocks.
Other solutions are available, each with their strong points, only not as powerful or less intuitive.

=over 4

=item * Test::MockClass

Very clearly named methods are used to create and control mocks.
Supports explicit call order. Does not provide unified flexible argument checking.
Call tracking can be disabled.

=item * Test::MockObject

Gathers calls made that you can check in your own code afterwards rather than building the expected call path before.

=item * Test::MockModule

You pass the code for each mocked method separately. Why not just write them in the test script instead?
Does not provide any other functionality besides declaring and undeclaring mock methods.

=item * Test::MockCommand

Mock external commands that your program calls.

=back

=head2 SUPPLEMENTARY MODULES

=over 4

=item * Test::CallFlow::Plan

A structure of calls the code under test should make.

=item * Test::CallFlow::Call

A single call that the code under test might make.

=item * Test::CallFlow::ArgCheck

Checkers for arguments to mocked function calls.

=item * Test::CallFlow::ArgCheck::Equals

Pass arguments that match given string or undef.

=item * Test::CallFlow::ArgCheck::Code

Pass arguments that given method returns true for.

=item * Test::CallFlow::ArgCheck::Regexp

Pass arguments that are defined and match given regexp.

=item * Test::CallFlow::ArgCheck::Any

Pass any arguments.
