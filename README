Test-CallFlow

Trivial planning of sub call flows for fast unit test writing.

Simply declare a package for mocking and start writing what method calls
are expected from your test and what values they should return:

    use Test::More test => 1;
    use Test::CallFlow qw(:all);
    
    mock_package( 'Pkg::Name' );
    Pkg::Name->new()->result( bless {}, 'Pkg::Name' );

    mock_run();
    eval {
        code_under_test();
        mock_end();
    };
    is( $@, '', "Calls made as expected" );

Provides
    * flexible call order checking 
    * easily expandable argument check system
    * recording of calls from real run for legacy code test template generation.

Depends on modules: Carp, Exporter, File::Spec.

Version 0.03.
