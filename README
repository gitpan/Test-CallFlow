Test-CallFlow

Trivial planning of sub call flows for fast unit test writing.

Simply declare a package for mocking and start writing what method calls
are expected from your test and what values they should return:

    mock_package( 'Pkg::Name' );
    Pkg::Name->new()->result( bless {}, 'Pkg::Name' );

Provides flexible call order checking and an easily expandable helper system for argument checks.

Depends only on a few other modules usually already installed with perl.

Version 0.01.
